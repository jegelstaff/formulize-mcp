  "description": "A local MCP server for connecting to Formulize, the open source data management platform.",
  "long_description": "Formulize lets people organize their data and customize the workflows around their data. Many Formulize users are not developers, they are power users who understand how their systems should work, and they can use Formulize to configure their database applications, instead of programming them. With this MCP server, people can connect Claude to their Formulize system, and have conversations about their data, and get Claude's help in configuring Formulize. Through MCP, people will be able to simply outline their use cases and business processes, and then Claude can use tools in Formulize to create the applications they have imagined.",
